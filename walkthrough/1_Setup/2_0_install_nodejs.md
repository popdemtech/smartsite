# Install Node.js

This walkthrough will cover building a web server application using Node.js. While JavaScript was initially developed for and still maintains its scripting dominance in a browser environment, Node.js is a JS runtime for use outside of a browser.

Node.js is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. While JavaScript runs natively in a browser (i.e. client-side), Node.js provides developers the platform with which to build applications for a controlled environment that runs on a host computer (server-side), separate from the JavaScript that is delivered to the client's browser. In this way, a Node.js application is comparable to PHP, Java, and Ruby, and other application environments that handle web-traffic requests, but are not delivered to the client.
