# `my-app` by Popular Demand

*Web Application Fundamentals Made Simple*

Hey everyone. Welcome to a guide to Web Development.

The purpose of `my-app` is to provide interested individuals with
a launch point for building a personal web application.

Before beginning, the individual must be able to:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Download and install programs</li>
  <li>Browse the internet</li>
  <li>Use the command-line interface</li>
</ol>

Using the command-line interface is likely the least familiar of the skills.
Luckily, commands that are **necessary** for building the application
will be given by the walkthrough. Still, because the command-line will be one of the primary development tools, beginner level proficiency is recommended.

The guides will present a path of Node.js web development that it known to work.
Differences in operating system and setup may require modifications to the instructions.

## The Process
There is One Step:
1. Follow the Walkthrough

## How to Read the Walkthrough

The Walkthrough is presented in three sections:
* Setup
* Basics
* Features

### Setup
The Setup section ensures the developer has the required libraries
and programs installed. Anyone who has been developing web applications
for any amount of time may already have libraries like node.js and PostgreSQL installed.
Regardless, go through the setup steps to ensure parity with the example application.

### The Basics
The Basics covers the key building blocks for creating a web application.
* Deliver static HTML pages
* Deliver dynamically rendered content
* Provide interactive front-end content
* Connect to a database
* Save user information in the database

After completing the Basics, the developer will have completed building a
full-fledged Web 2.0 application. With curiosity and initiative, any type of web
application can be built from the skills and tools outlined in the Basics.

### Features
The third section, Features, is an exploration of the range of applications
can be built from the tooling of the Basics. Features contains walkthroughs
for extending the functionality of my-app.

The Features are standalone front-end or full-stack modules that can be completed
in any order.

## How to Begin
Begin by `git clone`ing the parent repository.
```
$ git clone [repo_url]
```

The directory comes with the walkthrough containing the steps for building
out a Node.js application -- complete with local and deployed environment setups.

Begin with **Setup** -- install the libraries and run the Node installation commands.
As you continue through the tutorial, what began as a directory with not much more than a walkthrough blossoms into a featured and interactive 

## What Next
After you've comepleted building out `my-app`, you will have the tools of web development in your reach. With the skills, you can:
* Provide value on the internet with your app ideas
* Continue learning web development in pursuit of a career in software
* Prototype the next Big Idea (you'll know as much as Zuckerberg)

If you find yourself building out cool new features in your `my-app`, aid future learners by contributing a walkthrough to the `my-app` parent repository.
It will be added to the **Features** section as an optional add-on. Thanks in advance!

Cheers and Happy Building.
